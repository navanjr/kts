Dear County Taxpayer:

Our records show that your <taxYear> personal property taxes are delinquent.

In accordance with O.S. 68: 3102, the County Treasurer is required to publish a list of all unpaid <taxYear> taxes. Your name will be published in the Johnston County Capital Democrat and additional costs for advertising will be added unless taxes are paid on or before April 30, 2013.

<docUnpaidSum>

If these taxes are not paid, the county will place a lien against your property(real estate). You also risk cancellation of your homestead exemption.

Please note: Once the delinquent list has been sent to the newspaper, we cannot delete your name from the publication.


Sincerely,
<officialName>
<County> County Treasurer
