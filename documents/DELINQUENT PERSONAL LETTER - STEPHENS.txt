Dear Taxpayer:

Your 2012 personal taxes are unpaid and in accordance with O.S. 68:30102, the County Treasurer is required to publish a list of unpaid personal taxes.

On May 2, 2013 the unpaid personal tax will be published in The Marlow Review of <county> County. An advertising fee of $6.50 will be added after April 30. Within thirty days after publication such taxes will be placed on the personal tax lien docket with a lien fee of $5.00 added. This tax lien shall be a lien on all real estate and personal property of said taxpayer. Once the tax account is placed onthe lien docket, a Sheriff's Tax Warrant may be issued, which will result in additional fees.

If paying after April 30th, contact the Treasurer's office for the correct amount due.

Respectfully,



<officialName>
<county> County Treasurer
